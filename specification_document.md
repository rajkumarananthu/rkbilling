##### SPECIFICATION DOCUMENT FOR RKBILLING SOFTWARE

##### --> Objective:
A billing software that can be used in a restaurent/grocery store etc., I got this idea because I once was an owner for a food store which is basically a franchise. As per the franchise guidelines, we have to use a paid billing software. Then I decided to write my own billing software, so that in future businesses I can use my own software so that I can reduce that amount in my monthly expenses.

Later I thought that it may help some one in need. So making it opensource.


##### --> Features:
- Can add/change items to the menu
- Can add/change price to the menu
- Can add/change discounts in the store
- etc.,


##### --> Plan:
- First to develop the skeleton(working project in command line)
- Then we can add the graphical interface for easier navigation.


##### --> Working:
We will have a DB (I am using mysql DB in my case) for each store (we can centralize the DB thatâ€™s upto us/ for now I will design keeping in mind that for each store having a database). We will save the items and its details that are available at the counter/store in the DB. When a customer orders an item, we will get the data from DB and calculate the bill and store the bill details back in the DB.


##### --> Architecture:


GUI ---->   Common Code    <---->   DB


Common Code will handle the data insertion and data extraction from DB and handle the processed data to GUI.
